								<h3> <mark class="orange">What students say</mark> </h3>
								Below are a few quotes taken from end-of-quarter student evaluations I have received. The full set of evaluations is available upon request.<br><br>
								<blockquote>Every time when I saw Lucie, no matter in class, discussions, office hour or seminars, I can feel her passion on macroeconomics and it motivates you to study more. I think the best TA is not only someone who can help you on the courses, but also can make you like the course and want to go further in the subject. Lucie did a wonderful job in it.</blockquote>
							
								<blockquote>Lucie is just phenomenal. She's clear. Organized. Well prepared very knowledgeable. Just impressive. Even when outside of her comfort zone or challenged on complex idea she always pushes herself to figure out a good answer and will take the necessary time outside class to find out. Cherry on the cake: she's kind and compassionate.</blockquote>
								
								<blockquote>Patience, ability to manage multiple personality types, and the ability to accommodate different learning styles and needs. Explanations are clear, as intuitive as possible (in both a math and concept sense), and tailored to the needs of the class and/or individual to which they're being presented.</blockquote>
								
								<blockquote>You can tell she wants her students to succeed. She played a tremendous part of my success in the class.</blockquote>
