									<h4>Credit frictions and participation in over-the-counter markets [<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8sq8d0twfx0vea5/credit_frictions_participation_0701.pdf?dl=0">PDF</a>]</h4>
									<p> Journal of Economic Theory, September 2020</p>
									<blockquote> This paper formalizes a Nash bargaining game between two players constrained by capacity decisions made prior to entering the negotiation. In equilibrium, strategic interactions drive capacity choices to zero and shut trade down despite the existence of gains from trade. The game is embedded in a general equilibrium model of decentralized asset trade with credit frictions to investigate the interaction between availability of credit and investors’ participation, modeled through their choices of inventory and payment capacity. A partial
									access to credit is sufficient to restore trade. The strategic interactions between payment capacity and inventory generate endogenous heterogeneity in holdings, trade sizes and prices, and complementarity between money and credit.

									<h4>Gradual bargaining in decentralized asset markets [<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/sya22njuo265h11/GradualBargaining_RED_070820.pdf?dl=0">PDF</a>]</h4>
									<p> <i>Joint with Guillaume Rocheteau, Tai-Wei Hu and Younghwan In</i>
									<p> Accepted at the Review of Economic Dynamics</p>
												
									<blockquote> We introduce a new approach to bargaining, with strategic and axiomatic foundations, into models of decentralized asset markets. According to this approach, which encompasses the Nash (1950) solution as a special case, bilateral negotiations follow an agenda that partitions assets into bundles to be sold sequentially. We construct two alternating-offer games consistent with this approach and characterize their subgame perfect equilibria. We show the revenue of the asset owner is maximized when assets are sold one infinitesimal unit at a time. In a general equilibrium model with endogenous asset holdings, gradual bargaining reduces asset misallocation and prevents market breakdowns.

									<h4>Social engagement and the transmission of infection diseases [PDF coming soon!]</h4>
									<blockquote> This paper endogenizes the transmission of an infectious disease in an environment where economic and social gains arise explicitly from person-to-person contacts. When agents can decide whether to engage in interactions, complementarities in the participation decisions of individuals susceptible to contracting the disease generates a large multiplicity of equilibria through a composition effect. The more susceptible peers participate, the lower the risk of infection relative to the benefit of participation. A variety of infection dynamics can be simulated, including plateaus and multiples waves. In the calibrated version of the model, because adverse selection leads to too much isolation from susceptible agents, the cost of forgone interactions always offsets the welfare gains of flattening the curve and mitigating the human toll. When agents cannot opt out of the market but can instead choose whether to wear a mask, there is no such complementarity. In the calibrated model the human toll is even lower, at a much smaller fraction of the cost.</blockquote>

									<h4>Do financial frictions shift the Beveridge curve?</h4>
									<br>
									<blockquote> I propose the deterioration of credit availability as a 
										novel explanation for the outwards shift of the Beveridge
										curve in the US following the Great Recession. The model 
										implements a twist in Wasmer and Weil (2004): instead of
										looking for a loan to finance their vacancy costs, firms 
										borrow to cover a fixed cost of hiring required to
										convert a match into a hire. This timing allows labor
										market efficiency to drop following a productivity shock.
										I build a monthly index of loan approval and conduct an
										empirical exercise that confirms the relevance of the 
										credit channel.

									<h4>Unstructured Bargaining in the Laboratory</h4>
									<p><i>Joint with John Duffy and Daniela Puzzello</i></p>
									<blockquote>We  report  on  an  experiment  in  which  buyers  and  sellers  engage  in  semi-structured bargaining along two dimensions:  how much of a good the seller will produce and how much money the buyer will offer in exchange.  Our aim is to evaluate the empirical relevance of two axiomatic bargaining solutions, the generalized Nash bargaining solution and Kalai’s proportional bargaining solution. These bargaining solutions predict different outcomes when buyers are constrained in their money holdings. We find strong evidence in support of the Kalai proportional solution and against the generalized Nash solution when buyers face liquidity constraints. Our findings have policy implications, e.g., for the welfare cost of inflation in search-theoretic models of money.

									<h4>Frictional Cash Management</h4>
									<p><i>Joint with Sebastien Lotz and Cathy Zhang</i></p>
									<blockquote> We develop a dynamic general equilibrium model to study the role of banks in creating and reallocating liquidity and households’ cash management. Our approach combines a theory of financial intermediation where banks swap assets with different liquidity properties with a micro-founded model of households’ money demand. Households and banks negotiate the terms of the contract in an over-the-counter market which includes an exchange of illiquid assets for liquid bank liabilities and an endogenous transaction cost for cash management. We show how the agenda of the negotiation matters and discuss implications for monetary policy transmission through money growth, open market operations, and quantitative easing on interest spreads between liquid and illiquid assets, asset holdings, and transaction costs.</blockquote>
